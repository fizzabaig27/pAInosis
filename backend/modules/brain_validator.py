"""
modules/brain_validator.py
Pre-filter that runs BEFORE DenseNet121 to check if the
uploaded image is plausibly a brain MRI scan.

This prevents the model from running on chest X-rays,
random photos, or completely wrong inputs — the model
would still output a class (it doesn't know what it
doesn't know), so we need this gate.

For DICOM: uses metadata tags (reliable)
For PNG/JPG: uses image characteristics (heuristic)
